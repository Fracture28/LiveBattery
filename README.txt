LiveBattery is a desktop display for the battery indicating if the computer is plugged in, and what the battery level is to the nearest quarter

Currently there are four forms two in each of black and white which line up correctly at their current size (listed in Variables in each of the skins) at different sizes the icons are missaligned an require a bit of experimentation to get them aligned

I made LiveBattery in part because i couldnt find any battery indicators that i liked, feel free to edit and use how ever you want.

Enjoy
